#ðŸ”´ What is a Custom Chatbot?

## Problem
Today on so many websites, intranet sites or blogs there are search bars, that are either not giving any results or results that don't really capture what the user is asking. That is neither the user's nor the search bar's fault. It is mnore often just a problem of formulating the problem. Normally you are able to type in just a few words in a search bar. However, it would be much easier to describe your problem, what are you searching for or what you are iunterested in. Like you would talk to a real person.

## Solution
A Chatbot has the ability to have a natural conversation with the user and if it has the knowledge of the whole website, intranet or blog can give the user great recommendations.
